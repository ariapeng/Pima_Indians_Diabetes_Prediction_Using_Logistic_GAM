# Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Prediction_Using_Logistic_GAM
Preprocessing and prediction of Pima Indians diabetes data using Logistic Generated Additive Model method

Diabetes is a major public health problem worldwide, and the Pima Indians of Arizona and Mexico are high-risk populations of that. Their committed participation in diabetes research has contributed numerous data for scientists to study. In this project, the objective is to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians with a model that is both flexible and interpretable. With a binary response variable, we naturally consider logistic regression. Additionally, since the real world is not always linear, we add more flexibility to it with the generative additive model (GAM) technique. Hence, logistic GAM is applied to the data.
